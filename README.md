| Ex1   |                                                                        Create the method average, which calculates the average of the numbers it gets as parameters.                                                                         |   DONE |
| Ex2   |                                                                        Create a program that asks for the user's name and says how many characters the name contains.                                                                        |   DONE |
| Ex3   |                                                   Create a program that asks for the user's name and gives its characters separately. You do not need to create methods in this exercise.                                                    |   DONE |
| Ex4   |                                         Create a program that asks for the user's name and prints it in reverse order. You do not need to create a separate method for this.                                                                 |   DONE |
| Ex5   |                                  Create a program that asks the user for two words. Then the program tells if the second word is included in the first word. Use the String method indexOf in your program.                                  |   DONE |
| Ex6   |            Create a program that asks the user to input words until the user gives the same word twice. Use an ArrayList structure in your program.: "In the beginning there were the swamp, the hoe and Java." and a line break             |   DONE |
| Ex7   |                           Create the method lengths that gets a list of String variables as a parameter and returns an ArrayList that contains the lengths of the Strings in the same order as the original list.                            |   DONE |
| Ex8   |                                                                  Create the method palindrome that checks if a string is a palindrome (reads the same forward and backward)                                                                  |   DONE |
