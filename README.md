This is my first program or playground trying out java before officially starting with OOP labs. 😁

This program here asks the user to enter their name but once the user says that they will not the program exits 🥳...

# <center>About the repository</center>

This repository contains all the programs and the code we do in OOP labs, each lab can be found in it's own branch ( <em> because I like to practise git </em> 😂 ), and each branch has it's own README.md file <strong>explaining it's contents</strong>
